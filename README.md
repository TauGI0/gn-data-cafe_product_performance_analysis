## 3. Methodology

### 3.2 Data Validation



### 3.2 Data Cleaning

#### 3.2.1 Removing unnecessary/unusesable columns

Since this project is focus of analyzing the performance of the Cafe's menu items, columns **Payment Method** and **Location** are removed due to the followng reasons:

-The amount of missing values in the columns exceeds **50%** of the entire dataset.
-The column provide no major contribution in insights regarding menu item performance.

#### 3.2.2 Handling Missing or Inaccurate Values

Two main strategies were used:

**• Using Deterministic Relationships to Reconstruct Missing Values**

Columns **Quantity**, **Price Per Unit**, and **Total Spent** shares deterministic (functional) relationship.

$$
Quantity \times Price\ per\ Unit = Total\ Spent
$$

These three variables are mathematically dependent, meaning any missing value can be reconstructed using cross-field calculations as long as the other two fields are present. This approach ensured accurate imputation of missing Quantity, Price, or Total Spent values without introducing assumptions or randomness.

**• Reference-Based Imputation**  

If value in Item column is present, missing prices can also be determined using the reference price table above.  
If an Ttem value was missing but had a unique price → item inferred.

#### 3.2.3 Standardizing Missing Indicators

- For numeric and date columns, entries like ERROR, UNKNOWN, or blanks → replaced with Null.
- For string/text columns with missing values that cannot be reliably imputed (e.g., non-unique prices for items) → set to "Unknown".

### 3.3 Data Analysis

- Item sales volume: Measure of how many units of each item were sold.
- Total revenue contribution: Total revenue generated by each item.
- Menu Item Performance Rating: Combined metric of normalized sales volume and revenue to evaluate overall performance.
- Monthly transaction frequency: Number of transactions per month.
- Customer volume per day of the week: Insights into daily customer patterns and peak days.

### 3.4 Visualizations

  To visualize findings, a Power BI dashboard was created

- KPI Cards → Total item sales, revenue generated, and transactions
- Lollipop Charts → Top items in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated 
- Bar Chart →  revenue share, payment method  
- Line charts → Monthly transaction trend  
- Heat Map → Daily Customer Volume
